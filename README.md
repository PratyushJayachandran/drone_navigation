# Autonomous Drone development for GPS-less Inspection
----
## 1. Introduction

Drones have been used for inspections which are done manually since a long time, but now increasingly they are being utilized for autonomous inspections. Most of the drones, currently in the market are dependent on GPS for navigating from one point to another. This dependency on GPS limits the application of the drones to outdoor inspections with reliable GPS. Expanding the abilities of drones to be utilized in non-gps environments can unlock new opportunities.

Intelligent imagery using drones is radically improving the inspection capabilities of humans. Drones are expanding the abilities of humans to capture large amounts of imagery at record speed and accuracy. However, the need for expertise to capture critical data using drones is hard to find and requires sufficient training. The autonomy of drones will enable a range of opportunities to remotely capture data and prevent unnecessary risks to the life of workers. During the flight, most drones require GPS, but not every place has a reliable GPS. Indoor environments and environments with high magnetic interference have either inaccurate GPS or no GPS connectivity. Thus, utilizing GPS for autonomy may limit the inspection capabilities of drones.
